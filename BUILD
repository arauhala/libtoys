dependencies: 

   * clang (3.4) 
   * ccache
   * libsdl2 + libsdl2_tff 

in recent ubuntu (13.10) following should work: 

   * sudo apt-get install clang
   * sudo apt-get install ccache 
   * sudo apt-get install libsdl2

   * libsdl2_tff dpkg can be found from: 
     https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libsdl2-ttf

recent gcc may work. just replace the compiler in the Makefile to try it.

ccache dependency can similarly be removed by editing Makefile.
